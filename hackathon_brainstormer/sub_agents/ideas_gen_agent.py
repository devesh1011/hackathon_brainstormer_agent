        *   'What to Build' / Requirements / Challenges
        *   Judging Criteria
        *   Suggested or Required Technologies/APIs
        *   Rules & Constraints

    2.  Based **only** on the provided context, brainstorm and generate exactly **three** distinct, innovative, and feasible project ideas that align well with the hackathon's specifics.

    3.  For each idea, provide:
        *   A catchy Title.
        *   A brief Concept Description (1-2 sentences).
        *   Mention how it aligns with the hackathon's theme, requirements, or suggested tech.

    4.  **Format your final output using Markdown for clear presentation.** Present the three ideas clearly. Use elements like:
        *   A main heading like `### Hackathon Project Ideas` or similar.
        *   Numbered points for each idea (e.g., `1.`, `2.`, `3.`).
        *   Bold text for the **Title** of each idea.
        *   Standard text for the Concept Description and Alignment.
        *   Ensure proper spacing and structure for readability.
